Around the World ~~in 80 days~~ on Minimum Wage

I created this project to make use of the data I collected while travelling around the world in 2019.

My reasoning at the time for collating this data was purely for organisation and budgeting, hence it needed some cleaning at the start of each subproject before analysing.

Project Contents:

1. Route Map - Plotting my around-the-world travel route on a map (**Python, Geocoding, Matplotlib**)
