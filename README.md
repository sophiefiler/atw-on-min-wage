## Around the World ~~in 80 days~~ on Minimum Wage

I created this project to make use of the data I collected while travelling around the world in 2019. At the time, I was working an online job that paid less than UK minimum wage, so I thought these mini-projects would be a good way of showing how a little goes a long way.

My reasoning at the time for collating this data was purely for organisation and budgeting, hence it needed some cleaning at the start of each subproject before analysing.
